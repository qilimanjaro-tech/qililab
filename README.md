### Our Contribution Policy

This project is primarily intended for reference purposes, and we do not actively accept or manage external contributions, including pull requests and issue reports. Our development team maintains this codebase for internal use and does not have the capacity to review or merge contributions from the community.

### Why We Have This Policy

Our decision to limit external contributions is based on our specific project goals, resource constraints, and internal policies. While we understand the value of collaboration and open-source contributions, we have chosen to maintain this project as a reference rather than a collaborative, community-driven effort.
