# Release dev (development release)

This document contains the changes of the current release.

### New features since last release

- Added `Experiment.compile` method, which return the compiled experiment for debugging purposes.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)

  ```pycon
  >>> sequences = experiment.compile()
  ```

  This method returns a list of dictionaries (one dictionary per circuit executed in the experiment). Each dictionary
  contains the sequences uploaded for each bus:

  ```pycon
  >>> sequences[0]
  {'drive_line_bus': [qpysequence_1], 'feedline_input_output_bus': [qpysequence_2]}
  ```

  This experiment is using two buses (`drive_line_bus` and `feedling_input_output_bus`), which have a list of the uploaded sequences
  (in this case only 1).

  We can then obtain the program of such sequences:

  ```pycon
  >>> sequences[0]["drive_line_bus"][0]._program
  setup:
    move             1000, R0
    wait_sync        4
  average:
    reset_ph
    play             0, 1, 4
    long_wait_1:
        move             3, R1
        long_wait_1_loop:
            wait             65532
            loop             R1, @long_wait_1_loop
        wait             3400

    loop             R0, @average
  stop:
    stop
  ```

- Added support for setting output offsets of a qblox module.
  [#199](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/199)

### Improvements

- Change name `PulseScheduledBus` to `BusExecution`.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)

- Separate `generate_program_and_upload` into two methods: `compile` and `upload`. From now on, when executing a
  single circuit, all the pulses of each bus will be compiled first, and then uploaded to the instruments.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)

- Make `nshots` and `repetition_duration` dynamic attributes of the `QbloxModule` class. When any of these two settings
  changes, the cache is emptied to make sure new programs are compiled.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)

### Breaking changes

- An `out_offsets` attribute has been added to the settings of a `QbloxModule` object. This attribute contains a list
  of the offsets applied to each output. The runcard should be updated to contain this new information:

  ```yaml
  instruments:
    - name: QRM
    alias: QRM
    id_: 1
    category: awg
    firmware: 0.7.0
    num_sequencers: 1
    acquisition_delay_time: 100
    out_offsets: [0.3, 0, 0, 0]  # <-- this new line needs to be added to the runcard!
    awg_sequencers:
      ...
  ```

  [#199](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/199)

### Deprecations / Removals

- Removed the `AWG.frequency` attribute because it was not used.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)

### Documentation

### Bug fixes

- Fixed bug where the `QbloxModule` uploaded the same sequence to all the sequencers.
  [#225](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/225)
