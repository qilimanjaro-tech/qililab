# Release dev (development release)

This document contains the changes of the current release.

### New features since last release

- Added `pulse/pulse_distortion/` module, which contains a base class to distort envelopes in PulseEvent, and two examples of distortion child classes to apply. This new feature can be used in two ways, directly from the class itself:

  ```python
  distorted_envelope = BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=1.0).apply(original_envelope)
  ```

  or from the class PulseEvent (which ends up calling the previous one):

  ```python
  pulse_event = PulseEvent(
      pulse="example_pulse",
      start_time="example_start",
      distortions=[BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=1.0), BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=0.8)],
  )
  distorted_envelope = pulse_event.envelope()
  ```

  This would apply them like: BiasTeeCorrection_0.8(BiasTeeCorrection_1.0(original_pulse)), so the first one gets applied first and so on...
  (If you write their composition, it will be in reverse order respect the list)

  Also along the way modified/refactored the to_dict() and from_dict() and envelope() methods of PulseEvent, Pulse, PulseShape... since they had some bugs, such as:

  - the dict() methods edited the external dictionaries making them unusable two times.
  - the maximum of the envelopes didn't correspond to the given amplitude.

### Improvements

### Breaking changes

### Deprecations / Removals

- Remove the `awg_iq_channels` from the `AWG` class. This mapping was already done within each sequencer.
