# Release dev (development release)

This document contains the changes of the current release.

### New features since last release

- Added `get_port_from_qubit_idx` method to `Chip` class. This method takes the qubit index and the line type as arguments and returns the associated port.
  [#362](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/362)

- Added `pulse.pulse_distortion` package, which contains a module `pulse_distortion.py` with the base class to distort envelopes in `PulseEvent`, and two modules `bias_tee_correction.py` and `exponential_decay_correction.py`, each containing examples of distortion child classes to apply. This new feature can be used in two ways, directly from the class itself:

  ```python
  distorted_envelope = BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=1.0).apply(original_envelope)
  ```

  or from the class PulseEvent (which ends up calling the previous one):

  ```python
  pulse_event = PulseEvent(
      pulse="example_pulse",
      start_time="example_start",
      distortions=[
          BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=1.0),
          BiasTeeCorrection(tau_bias_tee=0.8),
      ],
  )
  distorted_envelope = pulse_event.envelope()
  ```

  This would apply them like: BiasTeeCorrection_0.8(BiasTeeCorrection_1.0(original_pulse)), so the first one gets applied first and so on...
  (If you write their composition, it will be in reverse order respect the list)

  Also along the way modified/refactored the to_dict() and from_dict() and envelope() methods of PulseEvent, Pulse, PulseShape... since they had some bugs, such as:

  - the dict() methods edited the external dictionaries making them unusable two times.
  - the maximum of the envelopes didn't correspond to the given amplitude.

  [#294](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/294)

  ```

  [#330](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/330)

- The `ExecutionManager` can now be built from the loops of the experiment.
  This is done by `alias` matching, the loops will be executed on the bus with the same `alias`.
  Note that aliases are not unique, therefore the execution builder will use the first bus alias that matches the loop alias. An exception is raised if a `loop.alias` does not match any `bus.alias` specified in the runcard
  [#320](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/320)

- The `Experiment`class has been changed to support a more general definition of experiment by removing the
  `circuits` and `pulse_schedules`. A new class `CircuitExperiment` inherits from the new `Experiment` class has the previous attributes and all the functionality the old `Experiment` had.

  ```python
  experiment = Experiment(platform=platform, options=options)
  experiment_2 = CircuitExperiment(platform=platform, options=options, circuits=[circuit])
  ```

  [#334](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/334)

- The `VectorNetworkAnalizer` instrument is now implemented into the workflow of qililab.
  The user can now create an `Experiment` and use all qililab features. The results of experiments using the VNA will now be saved into three different files: File containing the runcard, file containing the raw data (data saved in real time) and a file containing the metadata (experiment options and loops). Here is an example of a simple experiment using the `VectorNetworkAnalizer`:

  ```python
  platform = build_platform(name="sauron_vna")  # Load the platform
  platform.connect()
  # Set some values for the VNA
  platform.set_parameter(alias="VNA", parameter=Parameter.POWER, value=-20.0)
  platform.set_parameter(
      alias="VNA", parameter=Parameter.SCATTERING_PARAMETER, value="S21"
  )
  # Define loops and options for the experiment
  loop = Loop(
      alias="vna_readout_bus", parameter=Parameter.IF_BANDWIDTH, values=[100.0, 200.0]
  )
  options = ExperimentOptions(loops=[loop], name="test_vna")
  # Create the `Experiment`
  experiment = Experiment(platform=platform, options=options)
  # Build execution (needed) and run
  experiment.build_execution()
  experiment.run()
  # Access the results
  res = experiment.results
  ```

  [#360](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/360)

### Improvements

- The `get_bus_by_qubit_index` method of `Platform` class now returns a tuple of three buses: `flux_bus, control_bux, readout_bus`.
  [#362](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/362)

- Arbitrary mapping of I/Q channels to outputs is now possible with the Qblox driver. When using a mapping that is not
  possible in hardware, the waveforms of the corresponding paths are swapped (in software) to allow it. For example,
  when loading a runcard with the following sequencer mapping a warning should be raised:

  ```yaml
  awg_sequencers:
  - identifier: 0
    output_i: 1
    output_q: 0
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> platform = build_platform(name=runcard_name)
  [qililab] [0.16.1|WARNING|2023-05-09 17:18:51]: Cannot set `output_i=1` and `output_q=0` in hardware. The I/Q signals sent to sequencer 0 will be swapped to allow this setting.
  ```

  Under the hood, the driver maps `path0 -> output0` and `path1 -> output1`.
  When applying an I/Q pulse, it sends the I signal through `path1` and the Q signal through `path0`.
  [#324](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/324)

- The versions of the `qblox-instruments` and `qpysequence` requirements have been updated to `0.9.0`
  [#337](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/337)

- Allow uploading negative envelopes on the `QbloxModule` class.
  [#356](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/356)

- The parameter `sync_en` of the Qblox sequencers is now updated automatically when uploading a program to a sequencer.
  This parameter can no longer be set using `set_parameter`.
  [#353](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/353)

- The `VNAResult` class now holds the parameters `i` and `q` obtained from the trace of the
  `VectorNetworkAnalyzer` instrument.
  [#360](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/360)

### Breaking changes

### Deprecations / Removals

- Remove the `awg_iq_channels` from the `AWG` class. This mapping was already done within each sequencer.
  [#323](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/323)

- Remove the `get_port` method from the `Chip` class.
  [#362](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/362)

### Documentation

### Bug fixes

- Add `_set_markers` method to the `QbloxModule` class and enable all markers. For the RF modules, this command
  enables the outputs/inputs of the instrument. We decided to enable all markers by default to be able to use them
  later if needed.
