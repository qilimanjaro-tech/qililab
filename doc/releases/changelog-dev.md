# Release dev (development release)

This document contains the changes of the current release.

## New features since last release

- Added new ChangeLog!
  [#170](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/170)

- Added rf_on property to SignalGenerator
  [#186](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/186)

### Improvements

- Cast `chip` dictionary into the `ChipSchema` class and remove unused `InstrumentControllerSchema` class.
  [#187](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/187)

- Upload sequence directly to Qblox instruments, without having to save & load a `json` file.
  [#197](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/197)

- Changed `schedule_index_to_load` argument to `idx` for more readability.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Refactored the `Experiment` class, creating a method for each step of the workflow. The `Experiment.execute` method will run all these methods in order:
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

  - `connect`: Connect to the instruments and block the device.
  - `initial_setup`: Apply runcard settings to the instruments.
  - `build_execution`:
    - Translate the circuit into pulses.
    - Create the `Execution` class (which contains all the buses with the pulses to execute).
    - Initialize the live plotting.
    - Create the `Results` class and the `results.yml` file (where the results will be stored).
  - `turn_on_instruments`: Turn on the instruments (if necessary).
  - `run`: Iterate over all the loop values, and for each step:
    - Generate the program.
    - Upload the program.
    - Execute the program.
    - Save the result to the `results.yml` file.
    - Send data to live plotting.
    - Save the result to the `Experiment.results` attribute.
  - `turn_off_instruments`: Turn off the instruments (if necessary).
  - `disconnect`: Disconnect from the platform and release the device.
  - `remote_save_experiment`: If `remote_save = True`, save the experiment and the results to the database.

- When translating a Circuit into pulses, the target qubit/resonator frequency is now used to initialize the
  corresponding pulse.
  [#209](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

## Breaking changes

- Removed context manager from `Execution` class. Users will be responsible for turning off and disconnecting the
  instruments when not using the `execute` method directly!
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed the `ExecutionOptions` class. Now the user can freely choose which steps of the workflow to execute.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed the `Platform.connect_and_initial_setup` method.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed the frequency argument from the `Pulse.modulated_waveforms` method (and all the methods that uses this method
  internally). Remove `frequency` property from certain buses.
  [#209](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- The `Pulse.frequency` argument is now mandatory to initialize a pulse.
  [#209](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed the frequency argument from the `Pulse.modulated_waveforms` method (and all the methods that uses this method
  internally). Remove `frequency` property from certain buses.
  [#209](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- The `Pulse.frequency` argument is now mandatory to initialize a pulse.
  [#209](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

## Deprecations / Removals

- Removed the `ExecutionPreparation` class and the `results_data_management.py` file, and replace it with a
  `prepare_results` method inside the `Experiment` class.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed unused `connect`, `disconnect` and `setup` methods from the `Execution` class. These are used in the
  `Experiment` class, which call the corresponding methods of the `Platform` class.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

- Removed the `RemoteAPI` class. This class didn't add any functionality.
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

## Documentation

## Bug fixes

- Fixed wrong timing calculation in Q1ASM generation
  [#186](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/186)

- Fix bug where calling `set_parameter` with `Parameter.DRAG_COEFFICIENT` would raise an error.
  [#187](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/187)

- The `qibo` version has been downgraded to `0.1.10` to allow installation on Mac laptops.
  [#185](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/185)

- Fixed the `Platform.get_element` method:
  [#192](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/192)

  - Now calling `get_element` of a gate returns a `GateSettings` instance, instead of a `PlatformSettings` instance.
  - Add try/except over the `chip.get_node_from_alias` method to avoid getting an error if the node doesn't exist.
