# Release dev (development release)

This document contains the changes of the current release.

### New features since last release

### Improvements

- Added support for the execution of pulses with durations that are not multiples of 4. For this, a new
  `minimum_clock_time` attribute has been added to the runcard:

  ```yaml
  settings:
    id_: 0
    category: platform
    name: spectro_v_flux
    device_id: 9
    minimum_clock_time: 4  # <-- new line!
  ```

  When a pulse has a duration that is not a multiple of the `minimum_clock_time`, a padding of 0s is added after the pulse to make sure the next pulse falls within a multiple of 4.
