class Platform:  # pylint: disable = too-many-public-methods, too-many-instance-attributes
    """Platform object representing the laboratory setup used to control quantum devices.

    The platform is responsible for managing the initializations, connections, setups, and executions of the laboratory, which mainly consists of:

    - :class:`.Chip`

    - Buses

    - Instruments

    .. note::

        This class should be instantiated with the :meth:`ql.build_platform()` function, either by passing a :ref:`runcard <runcards>` (serialized platform dictionary)
        or a path to the location of the YAML file containing it.

        More information about the runcard structure, in the :ref:`Runcards <runcards>` section of the documentation.

    After initializing a :class:`Platform`, the typical first three steps (which are usually only required at the start) are:

    >>> platform.connect() # Connects to all the instruments.
    >>> platform.initial_setup()  # Sets the parameters defined in the runcard.
    >>> platform.turn_on_instruments()  # Turns on the signal outputs.

    And then, for each experiment you want to run, you would typically repeat:

    >>> platform.set_parameter(...) # Sets any parameter of the Platform.
    >>> result = platform.execute(...) # Executes the platform.

    Args:
        runcard (Runcard): Dataclass containing the serialized platform (chip, instruments, buses...), created during :meth:`ql.build_platform()` with the given runcard dictionary.
        connection (API | None = None): `Qiboconnection's <https://pypi.org/project/qiboconnection>`_ API class used to block access to other users when connected to the platform.

    Examples:

        .. note::

            The following examples contain made up results. These will soon be updated with real results.

        .. note::

            All the following examples are explained in detail in the :ref:`Platform <platform>` section of the documentation. However, here are a few thing to keep in mind:

            - To connect, your computer must be in the same network of the instruments specified in the runcard, with their IP's addresses. Connection is necessary for the subsequent steps.

            - You might want to skip the ``platform.initial_setup()`` and the ``platform.turn_on_instruments()`` steps if you think nothing has been modified, but we recommend doing them every time.

            - ``platform.turn_on_instruments()`` is used to turn on the signal output of all the sources defined in the runcard (RF, Voltage and Current sources).

            - You can print ``platform.chip`` and ``platform.buses`` at any time to check the platform's structure.

        **1. Executing a circuit with Platform:**


        To execute a circuit you first need to define your circuit, for example, one with a pi pulse and a measurement gate in qubit ``q`` (``int``).
        Then you also need to build, connect, set up, and execute the platform, which together look like:

        .. code-block:: python

            import qililab as ql

            from qibo.models import Circuit
            from qibo import gates

            # Defining the Rabi circuit:
            circuit = Circuit(q+1)
            circuit.add(gates.X(q))
            circuit.add(gates.M(q))

            # Building the platform:
            platform = ql.build_platform(runcard="runcards/galadriel.yml")

            # Connecting and setting up the platform:
            platform.connect()
            platform.initial_setup()
            platform.turn_on_instruments()

            # Executing the platform:
            result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)

        The results would look something like this:

        >>> result.array
        array([[6.],
                [6.]])

        .. note::

            The obtained values correspond to the integral of the I/Q signals received by the digitizer.
            And they have shape `(#sequencers, 2, #bins)`, in this case you only have 1 sequencer and 1 bin.

        You could also get the results in a more standard format, as already classified ``counts`` or ``probabilities`` dictionaries, with:

        >>> result.counts
        {'0': 501, '1': 499}

        >>> result.probabilities
        {'0': .501, '1': .499}

        .. note::

            You can find more information about the results, in the :class:`.Results` class documentation.

        |

        **2. Running a Rabi sweep with Platform:**

        To perform a Rabi sweep, you need the previous circuit, and again, you also need to build, connect and setup the platform.
        But this time, instead than executing the circuit once, you will loop changing the amplitude parameter of the AWG (generator of the pi pulse):

        .. code-block:: python

            # Looping over the AWG amplitude to execute the Rabi sweep:
            results = []
            amp_values = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]

            for amp in amp_values:
                platform.set_parameter(alias="drive_q", parameter=ql.Parameter.AMPLITUDE, value=amp)
                result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                results.append(result.array)

        Now you can use ``np.hstack`` to stack the results horizontally. By doing this, you would obtain an
        array with shape `(2, N)`, where N is the number of elements inside the loop:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> np.hstack(results)
        array([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3],
                [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3]])

        You can see how the integrated I/Q values oscillate, indicating that qubit ``q`` oscillates between the ground and
        excited states!

        |

        **3. A faster Rabi sweep, translating the circuit to pulses:**

        Since you are looping over variables that are independent of the circuit (in this case, the amplitude of the AWG),
        you can speed up the experiment by translating the circuit into pulses beforehand, only once, and then, executing the obtained
        pulses inside the loop.

        Which is the same as before, but passing the ``pulse_schedule`` instead than the ``circuit``, to the ``execute()`` method:

        .. code-block:: python

            from qililab.pulse.circuit_to_pulses import CircuitToPulses

            # Translating the circuit to pulses:
            pulse_schedule = CircuitToPulses(platform=platform).translate(circuits=[circuit])

            # Looping over the AWG amplitude to execute the Rabi sweep:
            results = []
            amp_values = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]

            for amp in amp_values:
                platform.set_parameter(alias="drive_q", parameter=ql.Parameter.AMPLITUDE, value=amp)
                result = platform.execute(program=pulse_schedule, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                results.append(result.array)

        If you now stack and print the results, you will obtain similar results, but much faster!

        >>> np.hstack(results)
        array([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3],
                [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3]])
        TODO: !!! Change this results for the actual ones !!!

        |

        **4. Ramsey sequence, looping over a parameter inside the circuit:**

        To run a Ramsey sequence you also need to build, connect and set up the platform as before. However, the circuit will be different from the previous one,
        and also, this time, you need to loop over a parameter of the circuit itself, specifically over the time of the ``Wait`` gate.

        To do this, since the parameter is inside the Qibo circuit, you will need to use Qibo own ``circuit.set_parameters()`` method, specifying the
        parameters you want to set, in the same order they appear in the circuit construction:

        .. code-block:: python

            import qililab as ql

            from qibo.models import Circuit
            from qibo import gates

            # Building the platform:
            platform = ql.build_platform(runcard="runcards/galadriel.yml")

            # Connecting and setting up the platform:
            platform.connect()
            platform.initial_setup()
            platform.turn_on_instruments()

            # Defining the Ramsey circuit:
            circuit = Circuit(q + 1)
            circuit.add(gates.RX(q, theta=np.pi/2))
            circuit.add(ql.Wait(q, t=0))
            circuit.add(gates.RX(q, theta=np.pi/2))
            circuit.add(gates.M(q))

            # Looping over the wait time t to execute the Ramsey:
            results = []
            wait_times = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

            for wait in wait_times:
                circuit.set_parameters([np.pi/2, wait, np.pi/2])
                result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                results.append(result.array)

        which for each execution, would set ``np.pi/2`` to the ``theta`` parameters of the ``RX`` gates, and the looped ``wait`` time  to the ``t`` parameter of the
        ``Wait`` gate.

        If you print the results, you'll see how you obtain the sinusoidal expected behaviour!

        >>> results = np.hstack(results)
        >>> results
        array([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3],
                [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3]])
        TODO: !!! Change this results for the actual sinusoidal ones (change wait_times of execution if needed) !!!
