class Platform:  # pylint: disable = too-many-public-methods, too-many-instance-attributes
    """Platform object representing the laboratory setup used to control the quantum devices.

    The platform is responsible for managing the initializations, connections, setups, and executions of the laboratory, which mainly consists of:

    - :class:`.Chip`

    - Buses

    - Instruments

    .. note::

        This class should be instantiated with the :meth:`qililab.build_platform()` function, by passing a serialized platform (runcard) dictionary
        or a path to the location of the YAML file containing it.

        You can find more information about the runcard structure, in the documentation :ref:`Runcards <runcards>` section.

    When you have an initilized :class:`Platform`, the typical first three steps (which normally only need to be done at the start) are:

    >>> platform.connect() # Connects to all the instruments.
    >>> platform.initial_setup()  # Sets the values stored in the runcard.
    >>> platform.turn_on_instruments()  # Turns the signal outputs on.

    And then, for each experiment you want to run, you normally would repeat:

    >>> platform.set_parameter(...) # Sets parameters in instruments.
    >>> result = platform.execute(...) # Executes the platform.

    Args:
        runcard (Runcard): Runcard dataclass containing the serialized platform (chip, instruments, buses...), created during :meth:`qililab.build_platform()` given a dictionary.
        connection (API | None = None): `Qiboconnection's <https://pypi.org/project/qiboconnection>`_ API class used to block access to other users when connected
            to the platform.

    Examples:

        .. note::

            All the following examples are explained in detail in the :ref:`Platform <platform>` section of the documentation. But a few thing to keep in mind:

            - In order to connect you need to have access to the IPâ€™s addresses provided in the serialized platform (runcard), and connection is necessary for the next steps of the examples.

            - You might want to skip the `platform.initial_setup()` and the `platform.turn_on_instruments()` if you think nothing has been modified since last time, but we recommend you to do it always.

            - `platform.turn_on_instruments()` does not actually turn the instruments of the laboratory on, it only opens and closes their signal output generation.

            - You can print `platform.chip` and `platform.buses` at any moment, to check the platform structure.

        1. Executing a circuit with Platform:

            To execute a circuit you first need to define your circuit, for example one with a pi pulse and a measurement gate in qubit q (``int``),
            and then you also need to build, connect, setup and execute the platform, which together look like:

            .. code-block:: python

                import qililab as ql

                from qibo.models import Circuit
                from qibo import gates

                # Defining the Rabi circuit:
                circuit = Circuit(q+1)
                circuit.add(gates.X(q))
                circuit.add(gates.M(q))

                # Building the platform:
                platform = ql.build_platform(runcard="runcards/galadriel.yml")

                # Connecting and setting up the platform:
                platform.connect()
                platform.initial_setup()
                platform.turn_on_instruments()

                # Executing the platform:
                result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)

            The results would look something like this:

            >>> result.array
            array([[5.],
                    [5.]])

            .. note::

                The obtained vlaue correspond to the integral of the I/Q signals received by the digitizer.
                And they have shape `(#sequencers, 2, #bins)`, in this case we only have 1 sequencer and 1 bin.

        |

        2. Running a Rabi sequence with Platform:

            To do a Rabi sequence, you precisely need the previous circuit and again you also need to build, connect and setup the platform,
            but this time, instead than executing the circuit once, you loop changing the gain parameter of the AWG (generator of the pi pulse):

            .. code-block:: python

                # Looping over the AWG gain to execute the Rabi sequence:
                results = []
                gain_values = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]

                for gain in gain_values:
                    platform.set_parameter(alias="drive_q0", parameter=ql.Parameter.GAIN, value=gain)
                    result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                    results.append(result.array)

            Now you can use `np.hstack` to stack the results horizontally. By doing this, you would obtain an
            array with shape `(2, N)`, where N is the number of elements inside the loop:

            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> np.hstack(results)
            array([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3],
                    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3]])

            You can see how the integrated I/Q values oscillated, indicating that qubit 0 oscillates between ground and
            excited state!

        |

        3. Running a Rabi sequence faster, circuit to pulses:

            Since you are looping over variables that are independent of the circuit (in this case, the gain of the AWG),
            you can speed up the experiment by translating the circuit into pulses only once, and then, executing the obtained
            pulses inside the loop.

            Which is the same as before, but passing the `pulse_schedule` instead than the `circuit`, to the `execute` method:

            .. code-block:: python

                from qililab.pulse.circuit_to_pulses import CircuitToPulses

                # Translating the circuit to pulses:
                pulse_schedule = CircuitToPulses(platform=platform).translate(circuits=[circuit])

                # Looping over the AWG gain to execute the Rabi sequence:
                results = []
                gain_values = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]

                for gain in gain_values:
                    platform.set_parameter(alias="drive_q0", parameter=ql.Parameter.GAIN, value=gain)
                    result = platform.execute(program=pulse_schedule, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                    results.append(result.array)

            If you now stack and print the results, you obtain similar results, but much faster!

            >>> np.hstack(results)
            array([[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3],
                    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3]])

        |

        4. Running a Ramsey, looping a parameter inside a the circuit:

            To do a Ramsey, you also need to build, connect and setup the platform as before, but this time the circuit is different from the previous,
            and you also this time you need to loop over a parameter of the circuit, concretely over the time of a wait gate.

            To run the Ramsey, you need to loop over the `t` parameter of the first Align gate. To do so, since the parameter is inside the
            circuit you need to use Qibo own `circuit.set_parameters` method, putting the parameters you want to set in the order they appear
            in the circuit construction:

            .. code-block:: python

                # Defining the Ramsey circuit:
                circuit = Circuit(q + 1)
                circuit.add(gates.RX(q, theta=np.pi/2))
                circuit.add(gates.Align(q, t=0))
                circuit.add(gates.RX(q, theta=np.pi/2))
                circuit.add(gates.Align(q, t=0))
                circuit.add(gates.M(q))

                # Looping over the wait time t, to execute the Ramsey:
                results_list = []
                wait_times = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

                for wait in wait_times:
                    circuit.set_parameters([np.pi/2, wait, np.pi/2, 0])
                    result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=1000, repetition_duration=6000)
                    results_list.append(result.array)

            so we were always setting `np.pi/2` to the `theta` parameter of the first `RX` gate, then the looped wait time `t` in the first `Align` gate,
            then another `np.pi/2` to the second `RX`, and finally a `0` to the second `Align` gate.
