class CalibrationNode:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """Automatic calibration Node class representing a node in the calibration graph.

    The calibration graph represents a calibration procedure, where each node represents a step of this calibration procedure. **Each of these steps consists of:**

    - **A Jupyter Notebook** to calibrate or check the data with (including its metadata for execution time checks). Such a notebook should contain the following:

        **1) An input parameters cell** (tagged as `parameters`). These parameters are the ones to be overwritten by the ``input_parameters``.

        **2) An experiment/circuit** with its corresponding loops for the sweep given by ``sweep_interval``.

        **3) An analysis procedure**, that plots and fits the obtained data to the expected theoretical behavior, finding the optimal desired parameters.

        **4) An export data cell**, that calls ``export_nb_outputs()`` with the dictionary to retrieve data from the notebook into the calibration workflow.
        This dictionary contains a ``platform_parameters`` list of parameters to set on the platform and might also contain "fidelities", for the fidelities notebooks.

        .. note::

            More information about the notebooks contents and execution, can be found in the examples below.

    - **Inputs to pass to this notebook (optional)**, which might vary for different calls of the same notebook, such:
        ``sweep_interval``, ``input_parameters`` (kwargs).

    .. note::

        If the same notebook is going to be used multiple times for the same ``qubit``, then you need to pass a ``node_distinguisher`` argument, so the :class:`.CalibrationController`
        makes the graph mapping correctly.

    Args:
        nb_path (str): Full notebook path with the folder, nb_name, and ``.ipynb`` extension, written in unix format: `folder/subfolder/.../file.ipynb`.
        qubit_index (int | list[int] | None, optional): Qubit on which this notebook will be executed. Defaults to None.
        node_distinguishier (int | str | None, optional): Distinguisher for when the same notebook its used multiple times in the same qubit. Mandatory to use in such case, or
            the :class:`.CalibrationController` won't do the graph mapping properly, and the calibration will fail. Defaults to None.
        input_parameters (dict | None, optional): Kwargs for input parameters to pass and be interpreted by the notebook. Defaults to None.
        sweep_interval (np.ndarray | None, optional): Array describing the sweep values of the experiment. Defaults to None, which means the one specified in the notebook will be used.

    Examples:

        **Notebook execution:**

        First the key functionality of this class is implemented in the ``run_node()`` method**. The workflow of ``run_node()`` is as follows:

        1. Prepare any input parameters needed for the notebook, including extra parameters defined by the user and essential ones such as the targeted qubit or the sweep intervals.

        2. Create a file with a temporary name. This file will be used to save the execution of the notebook and initially has the following format:

            ``NameOfTheNode_TimeExecutionStarted_dirty.ipynb``

            The ``_dirty`` flag is added to identify executions that are not completed. Since the data we would find such file is ``dirty``, not completed.

        3. Start the execution of the notebook. There are three possible outcomes:

            3.1) The execution succeeds. If the execution succeeds, the execution file is renamed by updating the timestamp and removing the dirty flag:

                ``NameOfTheNode_TimeExecutionEnded.ipynb``

            3.2) The execution is interrupted. If the execution is interrupted, the ``_dirty`` flag remains in the filename, and the program exits:

                ``NameOfTheNode_TimeExecutionStarted_dirty.ipynb``

            3.2) An exception is thrown. This case is not controlled by the user like interruptions. Instead, exceptions are automatically thrown when
            an error is detected. When an execution error is found, the execution file is renamed with the time the error occurred, adding the `_error` flag, and the program exits:

                ``NameOfTheNode_TimeExecutionFoundError_error.ipynb``

            A more detailed explanation of the error is reported and also described inside the notebook (see `papermill documentation
            <https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more detailed information).

        At the end of this process, you obtain an executed and saved notebook for manual inspection, along with the optimal parameters to set in the runcard
        and the achieved fidelities.

        ----------

        **Practical example:**

        To create two linked nodes, and pass them to a :class:`.CalibrationController`, you need:

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            import networkx as nx

            from qililab.calibration import CalibrationController, CalibrationNode, norm_root_mean_sqrt_error

            # GRAPH CREATION AND NODE MAPPING (key = name in graph, value = node object):
            nodes = {}
            G = nx.DiGraph()
            qubit = 0

            # CREATE NODES :
            for qubit in [0, 1]:
                first = CalibrationNode(
                    nb_path="notebooks/first.ipynb",
                    qubit_index=qubit,
                )
                nodes[first.node_id] = first

                second = CalibrationNode(
                    nb_path="notebooks/second.ipynb",
                    qubit_index=qubit,

                    sweep_interval=np.arange(start=0, stop=19, step=1),
                )
                nodes[second.node_id] = second

                # GRAPH BUILDING (1 --> 2):
                G.add_edge(first.node_id, second.node_id)

            # CREATE CALIBRATION CONTROLLER:
            controller = CalibrationController(node_sequence=nodes, calibration_graph=G, runcard=path_runcard)

            ### WORKFLOW TO DO:
            controller.maintain(nodes["second_q1"]) # maintain second node for qubit 1

        .. note::

            You can find the above code, but defining ``first`` and ``second`` as lists, in the :class:`CalibrationController` class documentation.


        |

        where **the notebooks ``first/second.ipynb``, would contain** the following:

        |

        **1) An input parameters cell** (tagged as `parameters`). These parameters are the ones to be overwritten by the ``input_parameters``:

            .. code-block:: python

                import numpy as np

                qubit=0

                # Sweep interval:
                sweep_interval = np.arange(start=0, stop=19, step=1)

                # Extra parameters for this concrete notebook:
                param1=0
                param2=0
                ...

        |

        **2) An experiment/circuit** with its corresponding loops for the sweep given by ``sweep_interval``.

            .. code-block:: python

                # Set the environment and paths:
                ...

                # Set the platform:
                platform = ql.build_platform(path=platform_path)
                platform.connect()
                platform.initial_setup()
                platform.turn_on_instruments()

                # Define circuit
                circuit = ...

                # Loop over the sweeps executing the platform:
                results_list = []
                for X in sweep_interval:
                    platform.set_parameter(alias=alias, parameter=ql.Parameter.X, value=X)
                    result = platform.execute(program=circuit, num_avg=hw_avg, repetition_duration=repetition_duration)
                    results_list.append(result.array)

                results = np.hstack(results_list)

        |

        **3) An analysis procedure**, that plots and fits the obtained data to the expected theoretical behaviour and finds the optimal desired parameters.

            .. code-block:: python

                def fit(xdata, results):
                    ...

                fitted_values, x_data, y_data, figure = fit(xdata=sweep_interval, results=results)
                plt.show()

        |

        **4) An export data cell**, that calls ``export_nb_outputs()`` with the dictionary to retrieve from the notebook into the calibration workflow:

            .. code-block:: python

                from qililab.automatic_calibration.calibration_node import export_nb_outputs

                export_nb_outputs(
                    {
                        "platform_parameters": [(param_name0, fitted_values[0], bus_alias0, qubit), (param_name1, fitted_values[1], bus_alias1, qubit)],
                        "fidelities": [(qubit, "fidelity1", 0.9), (qubit, "fidelity2", 0.95)]  # Fidelities in the output dictionary are optional.
                    }
                )

        where the ``platform_parameters`` are a list of parameters to set on the platform.

        .. note::

            If more than one `export_nb_outputs()` is used in the notebook, only the last one will be collected.

            3.2) The execution is interrupted. If the execution is interrupted, the "_dirty" flag will remain in the filename for ever. Notice after an
            interruption the program exits.

                ``NameOfTheNode_TimeExecutionStarted_dirty.ipynb``

            3.2) An exception is thrown. This case is not controlled by the user like the interruptions, instead those exceptions are automatically
            thrown when an error is detected. When an execution error is found, the execution file is renamed with the time that the error ocurred and adding the flag "_error":
