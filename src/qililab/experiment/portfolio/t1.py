    """Experiment to determine the T1 value of a qubit.

    The value of T1 is measured through the following sequence of operations:
        1. Prepare the qubit in the excited state by sending a Ï€-pulse to the qubit.
        2. Wait some time t.
        3. Measure the state of the qubit.

    Args:
        platform (Platform): platform used to run the experiment
        qubit (int): qubit index used in the experiment
        wait_loop_values (numpy.ndarray): array of values to loop through in the experiment, which modifies the t parameter of the Wait gate
        repetition_duration (int, optional): duration of a single repetition in nanoseconds. Defaults to 200000.
        hardware_average (int, optional): number of repetitions used to average the result. Defaults to 10000.
