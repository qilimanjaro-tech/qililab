class Cosine(PulseShape):
    r"""Cosine pulse shape like :math:`A/2 (1-\lambda_1\cos(\phi)-\lambda_2\cos(2\phi))`, giving a modified sinusoidal-gaussian.

    - :math:`\lambda_1` cosine :math:`A/2 (1-\cos(x))`: Starts and ends at height 0, with a maximum height A in the middle. Which is a sinusoidal like gaussian:

        .. image:: /classes_images/cos0.png
                :width: 300
                :align: center

    - :math:`\lambda_2` cosine :math:`A/2 (1-\cos(2x))`: Starts and ends at height 0, having two maximums heights A, with a node in between. Which is two sinusoidal like gaussians:

        .. image:: /classes_images/cos1.png
                :width: 300
                :align: center

    The finally function would be a weigthed sum of both ``lambda_1`` and ``lambda_2`` contributions, giving an intermediate modified sinusoidal-gaussian.
    Check the following graph from Wolframalpha, where y is the lambda_2 parameter: [https://imgur.com/a/tjatZsg].

    Examples:
        To get the envelope of a Cosine shape, with ``lambda_2`` equal to ``X``, you need to do:

        .. code-block:: python

            from qililab.pulse.pulse_shape import Cosine

            rectangular_envelope = Cosine(lambda_2=X).envelope(amplitude=1.0, duration=50)

        which for ``X`` being ``0.2`` and ``0.5``, look respectively like:

        .. image:: /classes_images/cosines.png
            :width: 800
            :align: center

    Args:

                    which fulfills the constrain: :math:`1=\lambda_1+\lambda_2`. Defaults to 0.
