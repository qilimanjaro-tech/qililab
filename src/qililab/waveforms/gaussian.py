    """Gaussian waveform with peak at duration/2 and spanning for num_sigmas over the pulse duration.

    Standard centered Gaussian pulse shape, symmetrically spanning for ``num_sigmas`` over the pulse duration.

    The normal distribution's parameters :math:`\mu` (mean) and :math:`\sigma` (standard deviation) will be therefore
    defined by :math:`\mu =` ``duration`` :math:`/ 2` and :math:`\sigma =` ``duration`` :math:`/` ``num_sigmas``:

    .. math::

        Gaussian(x) = A * exp(-0.5 * (x - \mu)^2 / \sigma^2)

    You can think of it, as if an infinite expanding gaussian, is symmetrically cut in the given ``num_sigmas``, then that cut is
    expanded to occupy all the pulse duration, and then is shifted down so that it starts at 0.

    Examples:

        To get the envelope of a gaussian waveform, with ``num_sigmas`` equal to ``X``, you need to do:

        .. code-block:: python

            import qililab as ql
            gaussian_envelope = ql.Gaussian(num_sigmas=X, duration=50, amplitude=1).envelope()

        which for ``X`` being ``1``, ``4``, ``6`` or ``8``, look respectively like:

        .. image:: /classes_images/gaussians.png
            :width: 800
            :align: center

        This comes from the following steps, parting from a "full" gaussian (big ``num_sigma``) [blue]:
            1. you cut a full gaussian to the given ``num_sigmas``, for example ``1`` [small purple].
            2. in reality this cut gaussian, actually extends all the duration [big purple],
            3. you shift/distortion down the cut gaussian, so it starts at 0 height [red].

            :align: center

        amplitude (float): Maximum amplitude of the pulse.
        duration (int): Duration of the pulse (ns).
        num_sigmas (float): Sigma number of the gaussian pulse shape. Defines the width of the gaussian pulse.
