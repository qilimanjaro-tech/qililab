    """Square (rectangular) waveform. Given by a constant height line.

    Args:
        duration (int): Duration of the pulse (ns).
        amplitude (float): Maximum amplitude of the pulse.

    Examples:
        To get the envelope of a square waveform, with ``amplitude`` equal to ``X``, you need to do:

        .. code-block:: python

            import qililab as ql
            square_envelope = ql.Square( amplitude=X, duration=50).envelope()

        which for ``X`` being ``1.`` and ``0.75``, look respectively like:
