### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug for `ExperimentExecutor`'s `_inclusive_range` function where the range for certain loops had overflows and didn't match the experimental result. Now it matches the `QProgram`'s result shape.
[#1066](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/1066)

- Fixed a bug in `load_sequence_by_id` where measurements were returned in an undefined order, causing incorrect results when processing sequences. Measurements are now ordered by `measurement_id`.
  [#1132](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/1132)

- Pinned spirack to ==0.2.12 as some newer versions may cause an error when importing qblox-instruments.
  [#1135](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/1135)
