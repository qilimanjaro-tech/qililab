# Release dev (development release)

### New features since last release

- Add qblox support for `qprogram.measure`. Now this method can be use for both Qblox Instruments
  and Quantum Machines. In the near future the `qprogram.acquire` method will be removed.
  [#734](https://github.com/qilimanjaro-tech/qililab/pull/734)

- Add `integration_length` attribute to `qprogram.measure` and create default measurement square weights
  when `integration_length` and no weights are given.
